# Decisions

Append-only log of architecture decisions. One entry per decision, newest at the bottom. Do not edit past entries; a reversed decision gets a new entry that supersedes the old one.

## 2026-09-03 — Record architecture decisions

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** We need a lightweight way to record why significant technical decisions were made, so future work by any contributor, model, or tool does not rediscover or accidentally reverse them.

**Decision:** Keep architecture decisions in `docs/decisions.md`, one entry per decision, appended chronologically. A changed decision gets a new entry that supersedes the old one.

**Consequences:** Decisions and their reasoning survive context resets, model changes, tool switches, and contributor turnover.
